#+startup: overview

- used to continue the execution of a process that has been stopped
  - such as by =SIGSTOP= or =SIGTSTP=
  - can be sent to a process to resume its execution after being paused

- Unlike some signals, =SIGCONT= always causes the process to continue regardless of its previous state and *cannot be ignored*
