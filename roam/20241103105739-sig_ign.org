#+title: SIG_IGN

#+startup: overview

- =SIG_IGN= is a constant used in C and C++ programming to ignore a specific signal

- When you set a signal's handler to =SIG_IGN= using functions like =signal()= or =sigaction()=, the process will ignore that signal entirely

- This means that the signal will have no effect when delivered to the process, allowing the program to continue executing without interruption from that signal

- This is useful when you want to prevent certain signals, like =SIGINT= (commonly generated by pressing Ctrl+C), from affecting your program.

#+begin_src c
#include <signal.h>

int main() {
    // Set the handler for SIGINT to SIG_IGN
    signal(SIGINT, SIG_IGN);

    // Rest of the code
    while (1) {
        // Your program's main loop
    }

    return 0;
}
#+end_src

- The type of =SIG_IGN= is =void (*)(int)=, which is a pointer to a function that takes an =int= as an argument and returns =void=
- This is the same type used for signal handlers in C. When you set a signal's handler to =SIG_IGN=, you are essentially specifying a function that ignores the signal.
