=SIG_IGN= is a constant used in C and C++ programming to ignore a specific signal.

When you set a signal's handler to =SIG_IGN= using functions like =signal()= or =sigaction()=, the process will ignore that signal entirely.

This means that the signal will have no effect when delivered to the process, allowing the program to continue executing without interruption from that signal.

This is useful when you want to prevent certain signals, like =SIGINT= (commonly generated by pressing Ctrl+C), from affecting your program.
