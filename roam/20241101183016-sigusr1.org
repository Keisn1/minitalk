#+startup: overview

* What is it?
- =SIGUSR1= is a user-defined signal in UNIX and UNIX-like operating systems.

- It is one of two signals, =SIGUSR1= and =SIGUSR2=, that are available for application developers to use for custom purposes.

- Unlike predefined signals like =SIGINT= or =SIGTERM=, =SIGUSR1= has no predefined behavior or meaning, so developers can define and handle it as needed within their applications

- This flexibility allows processes to communicate specific events or commands that are relevant to the application's logic

* How do I work with this Signal?

To work with =SIGUSR1= in a UNIX-like environment, you typically need to perform the following steps:

1. *Signal Handling in a Program:*
   - Use the [[id:849b510a-ea52-4129-9c3a-d57382ffee5c][signal()]] or [[id:27a65a29-3d91-4b9e-86c3-b31168910426][sigaction()]] system calls to define a custom handler function that will be executed when the process receives the =SIGUSR1= signal.

2. *Sending the Signal:*
   - 
   - You can send a =SIGUSR1= signal to a process using the =kill= command from the terminal or the [[id:78d0139d-68b5-453c-ac56-036cd091ed26][kill()]] system call from another program.
   - Using the command line, the syntax is:
     #+begin_src
     kill -USR1 <pid>
     #+end_src
     Replace =<pid>= with the process ID of the target process.

3. *Handling in Multi-threaded Programs:*
   - If your program is multi-threaded, ensure you configure signal handling correctly as signals are delivered to the process, and you may need to designate a specific thread to handle them.

4. *From Within the Same Program:*
   - A process can send a signal to itself using the [[id:69a88a1f-6e64-47ef-aa7c-5c4c8779ff86][raise]] function.
