#+startup: overview

- user-defined signal in UNIX and UNIX-like operating systems

- one of two signals (=SIGUSR1= and =SIGUSR2=), that are available for application developers to use for custom purposes.

- =SIGUSR1= has no predefined behavior or meaning (unlike predefined signals like =SIGINT= or =SIGTERM=)
  - so developers can define and handle it as needed within their applications

- This flexibility allows processes to communicate specific events or commands that are relevant to the application's logic
