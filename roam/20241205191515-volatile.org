#+startup: overview

- used to tell the compiler that a variable's value may change at any time, without any action being taken by the code the compiler finds nearby
  - important because it prevents the compiler from applying certain optimizations that could assume the value does not change when the code is executing
- ensure that every read or write to that variable is actually performed and not optimized away or cached by the compiler

Typical use cases for =volatile= include:

1. *Memory-mapped peripheral registers*
   - hardware can change the value of a register independently of the program.
2. *Global variables modified by an interrupt service routine*
   - meaning the variable can change asynchronously with the main program flow.
3. *Multithreading*
   - where a variable might be changed by another thread.
