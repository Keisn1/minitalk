    - associated resources
    - process control block that contains metadata about the process

- Key attributes of a UNIX process include:
  1. *Process ID (PID):* A unique identifier for each process.
  2. *Memory Address Space:* Contains the program code, data, and stack.
  3. *Execution State:* Indicates if the process is running, waiting, etc.
  4. *File Descriptors:* References to open files used by the process.
  5. *Context:* Includes CPU registers, program counter, and environment variables.

- can create child processes using system calls like =fork()=
- can execute different programs using =exec()= family calls
- OS manages processes by
  - scheduling them for execution on the CPU
  - handling process switching
  - managing process communication and synchronization
