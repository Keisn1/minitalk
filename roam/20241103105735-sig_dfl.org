=SIG_DFL= is a constant used in programming with the C and C++ languages (and others that use POSIX signal handling) to specify the default action for a particular signal.

When you use =SIG_DFL= as the handler in the =signal()= function or =sigaction()= system call, it instructs the operating system to revert to the default behavior for that signal.

Each signal has a default action associated with it, such as terminating the process, ignoring the signal, or stopping the process.

Using =SIG_DFL= allows you to restore the default handling after it has been changed.
