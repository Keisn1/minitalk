=SIGSTOP= is a signal used in Unix and Unix-like operating systems to stop (pause) a process.

Unlike other signals that can be caught or ignored by the process, =SIGSTOP= cannot be caught, blocked, or ignored.

When a process receives this signal, it is forcibly stopped by the operating system.

You can later resume the process by sending it a =SIGCONT= signal.

This is often used in job control within shells to stop and resume processes.
