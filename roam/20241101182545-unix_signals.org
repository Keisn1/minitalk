* What are UNIX signals?
- UNIX signals are software interrupts
- provide a way for [[id:fdafc7dd-2495-46da-bfdf-d17c3199ca72][processes]] to be notified of and respond to various events
- allowing for inter-process communication and handling of asynchronous events
- Signals can be sent by the operating system, other processes, or even by the process itself

- Processes can choose to handle signals in specific ways, either by executing a signal handler function or by ignoring the signal
- some signals, like =SIGKILL=, cannot be caught or ignored
- Signals provide flexibility and control over process execution and are fundamental in process lifecycle management in UNIX-like operating systems

* Signals
[[https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/signal.7.html][Manpage signal(7)]]
- Each signal has a specific name and number
  - and they are used to indicate different kinds of events
